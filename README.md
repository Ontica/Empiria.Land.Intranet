## Overview

Angular-based front-end application for land recording offices.

Empiria Land is a software components suite that provides information services for land recording offices, cadastral departments and other land management government authorities.

This repository corresponds to the new Angular-based system's front-end for the Land Recording System, used for land titles recording, certificate emission, documentation services and filing management.

If you are interested in the former intranet version based on ASP .NET, please [visit this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Land.Tlaxcala/tree/master/intranet).

## Quick start

This project is being built with Angular 11 and TypeScript 4.

It uses [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), so both the CLI and generated project, have dependencies that require Node 12 or higher, together with NPM 6 or higher.

**Make sure you have Node version >= 12 and NPM >= 6**

**Then install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (globally if possible), ensuring that you have installed **version 11** or higher.

```bash
# install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# check Angular CLI, Angular and TypeScript versions
ng -v
```

After that, please download and install this repo:

# change directory
cd Empiria.Land.Intranet

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# Use Angular CLI to start the server
ng serve --open
